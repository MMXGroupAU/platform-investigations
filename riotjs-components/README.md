## RiotJS components 

Open `index.html` on a browser and check the output.


The goal is for `index.html` to be clean and understandable, leveraging riotjs to keep element complexity and repetitive boilerplate in separate components.


## Running it

Directly with `file://` scheme

```
xdg-open index.html
```


With local server, accessible through `http://localhost:8888/`

```
python2 -mSimpleHTTPServer 8888
```
